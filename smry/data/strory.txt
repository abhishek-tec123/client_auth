Once upon a time, in a village nestled at the edge of a lush forest, there lived a poor farmer named Ram. Ram was a hardworking man, but no matter how much effort he put into his fields, he barely managed to feed his family. He had two prized possessions â€“ his oxen, Heera and Moti. These two oxen were not just animals to Ram; they were his friends and his only means of livelihood.

Heera and Moti were strong and sturdy. They plowed Ram's fields tirelessly and helped him transport goods to the market. The villagers often marveled at how well-behaved and loyal the oxen were, and they would say, "Ram is lucky to have such wonderful oxen."

One year, the monsoon failed, and the village faced a severe drought. The fields dried up, and the crops withered away. Ram was in despair. With no harvest to sell, he had no money to buy food or pay his debts. He was left with no choice but to sell his beloved oxen.

With a heavy heart, Ram took Heera and Moti to the village market. As he stood there, trying to find a buyer, a wealthy merchant named Lakshman approached him. Lakshman was known for his cunning nature and sharp business acumen.

"I will buy your oxen," Lakshman said, eyeing the strong animals. "I will give you a fair price."

Ram knew he had no other option, so he reluctantly agreed. Lakshman paid Ram and took Heera and Moti away. Ram watched with tears in his eyes as his beloved oxen were led away.

Lakshman, true to his nature, planned to use Heera and Moti for heavy labor. He was greedy and wanted to make the most out of them. He worked the oxen day and night, giving them little rest and food. Despite their loyalty and hard work, Heera and Moti were treated harshly.

One day, while working in Lakshman's fields, Heera collapsed from exhaustion. Moti, loyal to his friend, refused to move. Lakshman was furious and beat them cruelly. Seeing no end to their suffering, Heera and Moti decided to escape. That night, under the cover of darkness, they broke free from their yoke and fled into the forest.

Days turned into weeks as Heera and Moti roamed the forest, surviving on wild grass and drinking from streams. They longed for their old life with Ram but knew they could never return. The forest was vast and full of dangers, but Heera and Moti relied on each other and managed to stay safe.

One day, as they wandered near the edge of the forest, they heard a familiar voice. It was Ram! He had come to the forest in search of firewood. When Ram saw Heera and Moti, he couldn't believe his eyes. Overjoyed, he ran to them and embraced them.

Ram decided to take Heera and Moti back home. He knew he couldn't offer them much, but he promised to take care of them to the best of his ability. With the help of his neighbors, Ram managed to gather enough resources to start afresh. He worked hard, and soon, his fields were green again.

Heera and Moti, now back with Ram, were happy and content. They plowed the fields with renewed vigor, and the villagers once again marveled at their loyalty and strength.

Years passed, and Ram's farm flourished. Heera and Moti lived the rest of their days in peace, knowing they were loved and cared for. Ram often looked at them and said, "You are not just oxen; you are my family."

And so, the story of Heera and Moti reminds us of the bonds of friendship and loyalty, and how love and kindness can overcome even the harshest of adversities.
